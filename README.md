# Huddle-landing-page-with-curved-sections

This was an amazing challenge to work on, I learned lots of new things!

Things I learned: 
 - adding background curve images using " background-position: top/bottom; "
 - the two values in " background-size: 100% 100%; " stand for width and height
 - invalid email error message pop-up using " :not(:focus):not(:placeholder-shown):invalid "

References I took while taking on this challenge:
